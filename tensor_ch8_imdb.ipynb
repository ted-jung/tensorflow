       "       'i have seen several comments here about brando using a southern accent some of which felt it was a mistake when this movie was made racism and discrimination were very strong in the south the jim crow laws were still in effect civil rights was in it s infancy could this have possibly been a subtle social commentary a southern man in love with a woman of another race the same way mash was a subtle criticism of the viet nam war any thoughts another comment was made about myoshi umeki appearing cold anyone who has been in japan would understand the japanese people at least in my experience did not tend to show emotion in front of strangers there were strict social rules especially for men meeting single women americans in japan were totally foreign to this culture and the blunt attempts to meet women were shocking to the ladies one trait of the japanese was to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable which many american servicemen took as a sign that their advances were welcomed also remember that at the time represented in the movie japan had just been defeated and the occupying forces were treated with reluctant acceptance i think myoshi umeki gave a very credible performance of what her situation would have been watching her interaction with the american actors brought back several memories of my own experiences in the country i was able to meet a pair of lovely young ladies who after i convinced them i was not the typical american male taught me their language and their culture during my time in their country ',\n",
       "       'i liked this film very much the story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow there is no resolution to the story whatsoever and you are left to wonder what really happened since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this i especially like the dating scenes between the boys and i was drawn into their lives and of course any film with a naked staphane rideau will get a couple of extra points ;)',\n",
       "       'there s a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating considering that it was made in 1953 this is a very courageous movie about transvestites tackling the issue fairly seriously and sympathetically and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject and trying very hard not to stereotype the movie clearly makes the point that transvestites are not homosexuals and that aside from wearing women s clothing they lead a relatively normal life it deals with the pain of not being accepted in society the plot revolves around a police officer lyle talbot desperately trying to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a transvestite so you have to give everyone involved with this movie credit for taking on such a controversial in the context of 1953 subject having said all that i m also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely dreadful in trying to portray glen glenda s edward d wood pain the movie falls into silly and at times surprisingly again given the era sensual fantasies that make the story very hard to follow the acting is wooden at best none of the dialogue comes across as real the actors look and sound like people reading speeches written by others and worst of all there was no point to having bela lugosi in this movie this was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor man took on in the latter stages of his career pull the strings pull the strings poor lugosi s character called the spirit in the credits but really coming across as more of a mad scientist kept crying and nothing he did really seemed to have much connection with the rest of the movie for artistic merit the movie doesn t really deserve much more than 1 10 however for the courage involved in just putting it out i ll give it a 3 10 '],\n",
